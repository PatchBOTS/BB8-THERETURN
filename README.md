# BB8-THERETURN
In March 2019 I decided to rebuild my James Bruton V3 BB-8 electronics from the ground up. Here are my Results. 

I've posted the zipped Gerber files for the board. This can be uploading directly to PCBWay.com or other board house for fabrication. 
I've also posted a CSV for the digikey passive components needed to assemble the board.  
Here is a link to the digikey BOM (let me know if this isn't working)

Notes on Assembly. 
1. To make room on the board I only have through holes for the needed pins on both the Sparkfun Pro Micro and the BY8301-16p.  This means you will NOT be soldering all the pin headers onto the Sparkfun Pro Micro and you will need to CUT pins off of the BY8301-16p.  This also makes it a bit lighter :)
2. There is a built in programming port for the HC-05 module on the board. I recommend soldering the HC-05 module on first and using this programming port to get your Slave Binding address before continuing with assembly. 
3. There is mP3 solder jumper underneath the BY8301-16p labled "mp3 program"  you will need to solder this jumper for the board to work.  You will need to unsolder it to reprogram the mp3 player after installation. 



I Wil update this guide with pictures as soon as possible. Feel free to message me in the meantime with any questions.
